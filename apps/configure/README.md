On the device: responsible for holding and ensuring configuration. 

Launches the _VintageNetWizard_ if there is no Wifi configuration or if GPIO 17 is set to high for 5 seconds, as in the [VintageNetWizard example](https://github.com/nerves-networking/vintage_net_wizard/tree/e9199cad88842543602cdabc12148d509a336c2c).
